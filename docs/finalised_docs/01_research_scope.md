# HelixRAGxMem: Research Scope & Objectives

**Project Title:** HelixRAGxMem - Hybrid Knowledge Graph and Dense Retrieval with Multi-Agent Memory System  
**Domain:** Biomedical Information Retrieval and Reasoning  
**Timeline:** 16 weeks (4 months)  
**Phase:** Phase 1 Foundation  

---

## 1. Research Problem Statement

Current biomedical RAG systems suffer from three critical limitations:

1. **Retrieval Complementarity Gap**: Systems combine KG and dense retrieval without proving or leveraging their complementary strengths
2. **Memory-Agnostic Reasoning**: Lack of cognitive memory systems that learn and adapt from interactions
3. **Static Agent Orchestration**: Limited multi-agent reasoning capabilities for complex biomedical queries

## 2. Research Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Prove KG-Dense Complementarity**: Demonstrate that KG and dense retrieval methods complement rather than just combine
2. **Multi-Agent Memory Integration**: Develop cognitive memory system inspired by MIRIX for biomedical reasoning
3. **Entropy-Based Graph Reasoning**: Create novel graph traversal using entropy priority with LLM-based edge prediction
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Achieve competitive performance on standard biomedical benchmarks

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Observability Framework**: Implement comprehensive tracing for multi-agent RAG systems
2. **MCP Integration**: Demonstrate tool communication patterns for agent-based systems
3. **Extensible Architecture**: Design foundation for Phase 2 advanced features

## 3. Novel Research Contributions

### 3.1 Methodological Contributions
- **Entropy-Priority Graph Traversal**: Novel approach using `score = (1-edge_conf) / (hops+1)` with GPT-3.5 edge prediction
- **Quality-Gated Memory System**: MIRIX-inspired memory with reviewer-controlled insertion
- **Multi-Agent Biomedical Orchestration**: Planner ‚Üí Retriever ‚Üí Reviewer ‚Üí Explainer pipeline

### 3.2 Technical Contributions
- **Hybrid Retrieval Architecture**: DuckDB + NetworkX + BGE-large-en + FAISS integration
- **MCP-Based Tool Communication**: FastAPI server for agent-tool interactions
- **Comprehensive Observability**: OpenTelemetry + Jaeger integration for RAG systems

### 3.3 Empirical Contributions
- **Benchmark Performance**: Competitive results on VAT-KG and KG-LLM-Bench
- **Ablation Studies**: Systematic evaluation of hybrid vs. individual components
- **Memory Effectiveness**: Demonstration of memory impact on reasoning performance

## 4. Research Questions

### RQ1: Complementarity Analysis
*"How do knowledge graph and dense retrieval methods complement each other in biomedical information retrieval?"*

**Hypothesis**: KG excels at structured factual queries while dense retrieval handles conceptual and synthesis queries better.

### RQ2: Memory-Enhanced Reasoning
*"Can cognitive memory systems improve multi-hop reasoning in biomedical RAG applications?"*

**Hypothesis**: Quality-gated episodic and vault memory will improve reasoning consistency and personalization.

### RQ3: Entropy-Based Graph Traversal
*"Does entropy-based priority queuing with LLM edge prediction improve biomedical knowledge graph reasoning?"*

**Hypothesis**: Entropy-based traversal will outperform traditional BFS/DFS approaches in biomedical domains.

### RQ4: Multi-Agent Orchestration
*"Can multi-agent systems improve reasoning quality and explainability in biomedical RAG?"*

**Hypothesis**: Agent-based orchestration will provide better reasoning traces and quality control.
