## 2025-08-18: End-to-End Advanced RAG Pipeline Implementation

**Objective**: Document the series of major upgrades that transformed the retrieval system into an advanced, multi-signal, and context-aware RAG pipeline.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1.  **Smarter Database Creation (`build_kg_db.py`)**:
    *   The KG build process now enriches triples with essential `subject_type` and `object_type` information.
    *   Materialized two new statistical tables: `relation_stats` (for local, per-node relation frequencies) and `schema_map` (for global, type-level relation priors). These tables are critical for the advanced `RelationPruner`.

2.  **Semantic Relation Understanding (`build_relation_glosses.py`)**:
    *   Created a new script to generate descriptive glosses (definitions) for all relations in the KG.
    *   Computed and saved embeddings for these glosses, enabling fast semantic similarity checks between a query and potential relations.

3.  **Multi-Signal Relation Pruning (`relation_pruner.py`)**:
    *   Upgraded the `RelationPruner` to use a sophisticated, multi-signal scoring mechanism that combines three signals:
        1.  **Typed Priors**: Global likelihood of a relation between two node types (from `schema_map`).
        2.  **Local Statistics**: Frequency of a relation for the specific source node (from `relation_stats`).
        3.  **Semantic Similarity**: Cosine similarity between the query and relation gloss embeddings.
    *   This allows the pruner to dynamically rank and select the most relevant relations with high accuracy and context-awareness.

4.  **Context-Aware Edge Prediction (`edge_predictor.py`)**:
    *   The `EdgePredictor` now fully integrates with the new `RelationPruner`.
    *   It sends a highly focused and contextually-rich list of candidate relations to the LLM, dramatically improving prediction quality and reducing token usage.

5.  **Intelligent KG Traversal (`walker.py`)**:
    *   Overhauled the `KGWalker` based on expert recommendations:
        *   **Priority Queue**: Ranks paths using `(1 - confidence) / (depth + 1)` to balance exploration and exploitation.
        *   **Traversal Control**: Replaced the hard confidence threshold with a `top-K` selection of the best relations at each step.
        *   **Robustness**: Implemented per-path cycle detection and added time/node budget limits.
        *   **Efficiency**: Added caching for `EdgePredictor` calls to avoid redundant LLM queries.

6.  **Orchestrated Retrieval (`retrieval_engine.py`)**:
    *   The `RetrievalEngine` now serves as the central orchestrator, initiating KG traversals via the new `KGWalker`.
    *   The `search_kg` method seamlessly integrates the entire pipeline, from pruning and prediction to guided walking.

## 2025-08-18: Configuration and Security Updates

**Objective**: Update and secure application configuration settings and improve environment variable handling.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Configuration Management**:
   * Centralized application settings in `config.py` using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`
   * Implemented environment variable support for sensitive configuration
   * Set up proper path resolution for all file system paths

2. **Security Improvements**:
   * Removed hardcoded API keys from source code
   * Added `.env` file support for local development
   * Documented required environment variables in `README.md`

3. **Model Configuration**:
   * Configured BGE (BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) as the default embedding model
   * Added query instruction template for better retrieval performance
   * Set up paths for all data assets (DB, FAISS index, verbalized KG)

4. **Development Experience**:
   * Added type hints for better IDE support
   * Implemented configuration validation
   * Improved error messages for missing or invalid configuration

## 2025-08-11: KGWalker Test Fixes and Improvements

**Objective**: Fix failing KGWalker and RelationPruner tests to ensure robust knowledge graph traversal and relation pruning functionality.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Test Infrastructure Enhancements**:
   * Fixed type hints in test files to align with actual implementation
   * Updated test assertions to match the expected behavior of the KGWalker and RelationPruner
   * Added comprehensive test cases for edge cases and error conditions

2. **RelationPruner Improvements**:
   * Fixed type checking for node types in relation pruning
   * Enhanced validation of input parameters
   * Improved error messages for better debugging

3. **KGWalker Core Fixes**:
   * Corrected traversal logic to properly handle node types and relations
   * Fixed issues with cycle detection and path tracking
   * Improved handling of edge cases in the traversal algorithm

4. **Test Coverage**:
   * Added tests for empty graph scenarios
   * Included tests for nodes with no outgoing edges
   * Verified behavior with various graph configurations

## 2025-08-10: Advanced Retrieval Pipeline Implementation

**Objective**: Implement and integrate the core components for an advanced, LLM-guided retrieval system.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1.  **State-of-the-Art Relation Curation**:
    *   Successfully rebuilt the DuckDB knowledge graph to include node type information, enabling context-aware operations.
    *   Implemented the `RelationPruner` service (`src/core/relation_pruner.py`), which dynamically loads the graph schema and provides context-aware relation candidates for any given node. This significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of edge prediction.
    *   Verified the entire data pipeline with a dedicated test script (`scripts/test_relation_pruning.py`), confirming that the pruner delivers the correct, pruned list of relations for a given entity type.

2.  **Intelligent Edge Prediction**:
    *   The `OpenAIEdgePredictor` (`src/core/edge_predictor.py`) now seamlessly integrates with the `RelationPruner` to construct highly contextualized prompts, guiding the LLM to make more accurate and relevant predictions.
    *   End-to-end tests confirm that the pruned relations are correctly embedded in the final prompt sent to the LLM.

3.  **LLM-Guided Knowledge Graph Traversal**:
    *   Implemented the `KGWalker` (`src/core/walker.py`), which performs entropy-based random walks on the knowledge graph, guided by the `EdgePredictor`.
    *   The `RetrieverAgent` (`src/agents/retriever.py`) has been rebuilt to use the `KGWalker`, enabling it to execute sophisticated, multi-hop graph traversals as part of its retrieval strategy.

**Outcome**: The core components of the advanced retrieval pipeline are now implemented and integrated. The system can now perform context-aware, LLM-guided traversals of the biomedical knowledge graph, a critical step towards achieving state-of-the-art performance in complex reasoning tasks.
